        <h3>2024-07-14: First Week ‚úÖ </h3>
        <p> I started my first week of the Front End core where I am learning the fundamentals of HTML. 
            I concluded my week with learning about HTML forms and the different user inputs that I could
        incorporate for visitors of a future webpage to collect user info and such.</P>

        <h3> 2024-07-13: Revisiting Python üêç </h3>
        <p>
            Due to unforseen circumstances, we didn't have class, so I spent some time reviewing Python
            concepts to continue to exercise my knowledge because reinforcement is critical to mastering
            a language.
